# Thoughts on the Applicability of Machine Learning to Scientific Discovery and Possible Future Research Directions (Perspective)

This repository contains the LaTeX source and assets for *"Thoughts on the Applicability of Machine Learning to Scientific Discovery and Possible Future Research Directions (Perspective)"*.

The original version of this paper was published at [3rd AI4Science Workshop at NeurIPS 2022](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/neurips22.html). I released the LaTex source for this version as [neurips-ws-2022](https://github.com/t46/perspective-ai-for-science/releases/tag/neurips-ws-2022). Therefore, if you would like to get the source at the time of publication, please refer to the repository tagged with [neurips-ws-2022](https://github.com/t46/perspective-ai-for-science/tree/neurips-ws-2022).

## Post-Publication Review & Contribution
In machine learning research, pre-publication peer review faces difficulty since the number of research papers is rapidly increasing compared with that of reviewers. I believe that the post-publication review would address this problem, where researchers continuously evaluate a research paper after publication. Therefore, I accept reviews on my research paper as an [issue](https://github.com/t46/perspective-ai-for-science/issues). Finding something you think could be improved or wrong, please create an issue. I will update my research in response to the issue when I have time.

Although Iâ€™ll do my best, I may not be able to take the time to respond to these improvement requests. So it would be more helpful if you could send me your suggestions for improvement as a [pull request](https://github.com/t46/perspective-ai-for-science/pulls). I provide the Tex file, BibTex file, and other assets to generate my paper. Thus, you can modify them directly in your local environment or OverLeaf. If you send me these modifications as a pull request, I'll review them and incorporate them into the paper.

## Authorship
Although the author of `neurips-ws-2022` ver. is [Shiro Takagi](https://t46.github.io/), the authors of the subsequent versions are all contributors to this research project. Therefore, I will show in the paper contributors to the repositories that manage the papers and research as authors.

## Citation
If you would like to cite the camera-ready version of the paper published at at [3rd AI4Science Workshop at NeurIPS 2022](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/neurips22.html), please refer to the `neurips-ws-2022` release. If you wish to cite a paper of a later version, please cite the following. Note that you add the commit hash of the repository containing the paper you are citing at the end of the URL, as the paper may change from version to version. 

I set the author as [t46](https://github.com/t46), the administrator of this research project, for BibTex's convenience. However, the authors of this paper are all contributors, as mentioned above.
